
### SCRIPTS:

- Y_shaped.py   train the model -> attention at the beginning. You have to choose the amount of noise and if you load a backup

- Y_shaped_pinns.py   define the NN class

- test.txt       contains all the L2 errors


### Inputs:

Contains input data for training and testing


######## Figures, Results and Model

Here I have the part concerning noise analysis.
In particular I have 6 trials
trials 1 & 2 -> for 1% of noise
trials 3 & 4 -> for 5% of noise
trials 5 & 6 -> for 10% of noise

### Figures:
It contains all figures for all trials. These plots are obtained adding noise to BOTH area and velocity

### Model:
It contains backups of all trials and also noise data for area and velocity

### Results:
It contains predictions (testing part) that are used for plottings
In addition, it contains losses
