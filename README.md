# Physical-Informed-Neural-Networks-Project
Use of 1D Navier-Stokes equations as constraints to Neural Networks for predicting blood
pressure, velocity and cross sectional area for an upper extremity model.

The codes in this folder are referring to a Y-shaped bifurcation.
An application to a complete upper-hand model has been extended in the corresponding folder
